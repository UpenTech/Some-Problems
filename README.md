#PigLatin Challenge
#Intro
I found this interesting challenge in Sololearn Community Challenges where you are given a sentence and you have to convert it into PigLatin. So what basically is PigLatin?
PigLatin is a language(hypothetical) sub-derived by rearranging the letters of English words such that the 1st letter is moved to the last whereby other remains in its usual position 
and then adding an extra "ay" to the end of the word.  
Example: Batman (English)
         atmanBay (Piglatin)
